# Draggin.js
A fully multi-platform Javascript library for creating interactive user interfaces.
## [DEMO](https://draggin.surge.sh)
## Inspiration
This project was created with simplicity and abstraction in mind. Draggin.js is the first complete drag and drop library that you can use without writing a single line of Javascript. I wanted a library that I could use with ease, instead of spending extra time configuring a heavy library.
## Features
- *SERIOUSLY* Lightweight (3kb when compressed!)
- **Fully** touch compatible
- No need to write Javascript code
- Once included, is **instantly** usable
- Editable text!
